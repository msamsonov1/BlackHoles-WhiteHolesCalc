Black Hole and White Hole Calculator
This repository contains a calculator for exploring the properties of black holes and white holes based on the Schwarzschild metric.

Features
Calculate Schwarzschild Radius: Determine the event horizon radius for a given mass.
Time Dilation: Calculate the time dilation experienced by an observer near a black hole relative to a distant observer.
Gravitational Redshift: Calculate the redshift of light emitted from near a black hole.
White Hole Trajectory: Simulate the trajectory of an object ejected from a white hole.
Visualization: Generate plots to visualize the effects of black holes and white holes on spacetime.
